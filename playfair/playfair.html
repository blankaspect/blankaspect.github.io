      <p class="wrap">
        The <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher">Playfair
        cipher</a> is a cryptographic cipher that was devised in the 19th century.  It is far
        too weak to be used in modern cryptography, but it is occasionally used in thematic
        cryptic crosswords such as the <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azed">Azed</a>, which appears in <i>The Observer</i>
        newspaper (UK), and the Listener crossword, which appears in the Saturday edition of
        <i>The Times</i> newspaper (UK).  This application is intended to assist in solving the
        Playfair element of those crossword puzzles.

        The user interface of the Playfair application consists of two panes:
      </p>
      <ul class="continuationList">
        <li class="wrap">
          In the upper pane, you can <a href="#sectionEncryption">perform encryption and
          decryption</a> with a Playfair code square that is constructed from a specified key.
        </li>
        <li class="wrap">
          In the lower pane, you can <a href="#sectionSolutions">search for solutions</a> to a
          Playfair cipher by providing some mappings from plaintext to ciphertext.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      
    <div id="sectionEncryption">
      <h2>Performing encryption and decryption</h2>
      <p class="wrap">
        Encryption and decryption are controlled with the components in the upper pane of the
        user interface.  Before you can encrypt or decrypt, you must set the key of the cipher
        by entering the keyword in the <span class="component">Keyword</span> field and then
        clicking the <span class="component">Set key</span> button.  When a key is set, the code
        square will be updated and the <span class="component">Plaintext</span> and <span
        class="component">Ciphertext</span> fields and their adjacent buttons, <span
        class="component">Encrypt</span> and <span class="component">Decrypt</span>, will be
        enabled.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The Playfair alphabet consists of 25 letters, which, by convention, are the 26 letters
        of the English alphabet without the letter <span class="keyword">J</span>.  <span
        class="keyword">I</span> serves for both <span class="keyword">I</span> and <span
        class="keyword">J</span>: when setting a key or performing encryption, any occurrences
        of the letter <span class="keyword">J</span> in the keyword or plaintext are replaced by
        <span class="keyword">I</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        In creating a key from a keyword, only the first occurrence of a particular letter is
        used; subsequent occurrences of the letter are ignored.  The remaining letters of the
        Playfair alphabet are appended in alphabetical order to the sequence of unique letters
        from the keyword.  For example, if the keyword were <span
        class="keyword">PSEUDORANDOM</span>, the key of the cipher would be <span
        class="keyword">PSEUDORANMBCFGHIKLQTVWXYZ</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        To perform encryption, enter the word to be encrypted in the <span
        class="component">Plaintext</span> field and click the <span
        class="component">Encrypt</span> button.  The encrypted word will be displayed in the
        <span class="component">Ciphertext</span> field.  Conversely, to perform decryption,
        enter the word to be decrypted in the <span class="component">Ciphertext</span> field
        and click the <span class="component">Decrypt</span> button.  The decrypted word will be
        displayed in the <span class="component">Plaintext</span> field.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        Because the Playfair cipher operates on pairs of letters, the length of plaintext and
        ciphertext must be even.  In some crosswords, plaintext with an odd number of letters is
        allowed by appending a specified letter to it, thereby padding it to an even length for
        encryption.  In such cases, you can select the letter from the <span
        class="component">Padding</span> drop-down list; when encrypting, the selected letter
        will be appended automatically to plaintext whose length is odd.
      </p>      
      <p class="wrap">
        When a word is encrypted or decrypted, it is split into a sequence of pairs of letters.
        Pairs of identical letters are not allowed in either the plaintext or the ciphertext,
        though two successive identical letters are allowed if they don&apos;t correspond to a
        logical pairing.  For example, <span class="keyword">ASSENT</span> (AS-SE-NT) is allowed
        but <span class="keyword">PASSED</span> (PA-SS-ED) is not.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If you press the Enter key when one of the three text fields has keyboard focus, it will
        have the same effect as clicking the button adjacent to the field.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="sectionSolutions">
      <h2>Searching for solutions to a Playfair cipher</h2>
      <p class="wrap">
        The search for solutions to a Playfair cipher is controlled with the components in the
        lower pane of the user interface.  To perform the search, you must enter some mappings
        from plaintext to ciphertext in the <span class="component">Mappings</span> text area,
        then click the <span class="component">Solve</span> button.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A <i>mapping</i> is a line of text consisting of plaintext and ciphertext separated by
        whitespace (spaces (U+0020) or tab characters (U+0009)).  The plaintext must consist
        entirely of letters, while the ciphertext may contain either letters or <span
        class="keyword">?</span> characters (U+003F), with each <span class="keyword">?</span>
        character denoting an unknown letter.  The plaintext and ciphertext must have the same
        length, which must be even.  Pairs of identical letters in either the plaintext or the
        ciphertext are not allowed if the letters correspond to a logical pairing, as described
        in the previous section.  There may be whitespace before the plaintext or after the
        ciphertext.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The text in the <span class="component">Mappings</span> area may consist of multiple
        lines, with no more than one mapping per line.  Blank lines are ignored.  The <span
        class="keyword">#</span> character (U+0023) is deemed to introduce a comment, and any
        text from a <span class="keyword">#</span> character to the end of the line is ignored.
        The mappings must contain at least one <em>complete</em> mapping from a pair of
        plaintext letters to a pair of ciphertext letters (that is, one in which both ciphertext
        letters are specified).
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        You can limit the number of solutions that will be found in a search by entering the
        required value in the <span class="component">Maximum number of solutions</span> field.
        By default, the upper limit is 500 solutions, which is the number of solutions for the
        minimal mapping from a pair of plaintext letters to a pair of ciphertext letters.
        Solutions are not found in order of their plausibility: if the upper limit is too low,
        the best candidate may be missed.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        When you have entered all the mappings in the <span class="component">Mappings</span>
        text area, click the <span class="component">Solve</span> button to begin the search for
        solutions.  If there are no errors in the mappings, a list of the solutions that are
        found will be displayed in the <span class="component">Solutions</span> text area.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If there are errors in any of the mappings (eg, the plaintext and ciphertext are of
        different lengths), a message relating to the first error will be displayed and the
        <span class="component">Solutions</span> area will be cleared.  A line number in an
        error message is <em>one-based</em> (ie, the first line of text is line 1).  An index in
        an error message denotes the <em>zero-based</em> index of a letter in the plaintext or
        ciphertext of a specified line.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The list of solutions is preceded by some information about the search: the maximum
        number of solutions and the number of solutions that were found.  Each solution consists
        of a Playfair square in linear form (ie, a possible key for the cipher), with a dot in
        the place of each unknown entry.  Unless the mappings contain information on all 25
        letters, the key will be incomplete, and you will have to infer the missing letters.
        The number in parentheses after each solution is the minimum length of the keyword,
        which is calculated from the length of the &quot;tail&quot; &mdash; the letters in
        alphabetical order that follow the keyword.  (In a fancier user interface, the letters
        of the solution corresponding to the minimum length would be highlighted.)  The
        solutions are listed in order of increasing minimum length of the keyword, and the more
        plausible keywords will be found towards the top of the list.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The following example contains several mappings for Playfair-encrypted entries in a
        crossword.  The keyword, <span class="keyword">OBSERVANTLY</span>, appears as a comment:
      </p>
      <pre class="example"># OBSERVANTLY

ANYHOW   N?HQ??
MELTED   XT??SF
LINCTURE ??ADAX?R
RIBOSOME B?SBEB??
BECALM   SR??TP
OUTFIT   ??FM?A</pre>
      <p class="wrap">
        If you copy the example, paste it into the <span class="component">Mappings</span> text
        area and click the <span class="component">Solve</span> button, a list of 100 solutions
        should be displayed in the <span class="component">Solutions</span> text area.  The
        keyword, <span class="keyword">OBSERVANTLY</span>, with the <span
        class="keyword">V</span> missing, is the second item in the list.  (In this example,
        <span class="keyword">BSEROANTLY</span> is also a valid keyword, but is unlikely to be
        the keyword for a crossword because it is not a word in the English language.)
